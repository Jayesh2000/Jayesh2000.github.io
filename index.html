                <p>
                    Master's student at Purdue University specializing in Computer Engineering, with 4 years of experience as an Embedded Software Engineer at Texas Instruments' Jacinto Processors Division. My work focuses on automotive and industrial sectors, where I've contributed to Linux bring-up, maintained critical subsystems, and actively participated in open source projects. I'm seeking a challenging role in Embedded Systems or Software Engineering where I can leverage my expertise in computer architecture and embedded systems to drive innovation.
